Day 1 – Introduction to Python (for DevOps)
1.A Brief History of Python

Created: 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.

First Release: 1991 (Python 0.9.0).

Philosophy: Python emphasizes simplicity, readability, and productivity. Inspired by ABC language.

Version milestones:

Python 2.x (2000): Widely adopted, but not fully compatible with Python 3.

Python 3.x (2008): Major upgrade, focused on modernization (Unicode support, cleaner syntax).

Current (2025): Python 3.12+ is the stable version.
Fun fact: The name Python was inspired by the British comedy show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, not the snake .

2. Why Python for DevOps?

✅ Simple & Readable — ideal for scripting and automation.

✅ Cross-platform — works on Linux, Windows, macOS.

✅ Huge Ecosystem — libraries for cloud (boto3 for AWS), containers (docker-py), infra (Ansible uses Python), etc.

✅ Great for Glue Code — easily integrates different tools and APIs.

✅ Popular in DevOps — used in CI/CD, monitoring, infrastructure automation, security scanning.

3. ⚡ Setting Up Python

Check if Python is installed:

python3 --version


Install Python (if not installed):

Linux: sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

macOS: brew install python

Windows: Download from python.org
4.Your First Python Script

Save this as hello.py:

print("Hello, DevOps World!)


Run it:

python3 hello.py


Output:

Hello, DevOps World!
